    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a **financial asset** whose value at a time $t$ is $S(t)$. The volatility of the asset will be $\\sigma$, and the price of the asset at $t=0$ will be $S_0$. The **risk free rate** will be $r$. Under this considerations we are going to create a **financial product** based on the evolution of the underlying wich a definite duration time (**maturity**): $T$. This product will be characterized by its **return** that will be a function that will depends of the price of the underlying and of the *maturity*:  $f=f(S(t), T)$. The question is: **What is the price of our financial product at a time t when underlying is S(t): $V_f(S(t), t)$?**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have:\n",
    "\n",

    "One model for obtaining this $V_f(S(t), t)$ is the **Black-Scholes** which relies in the following assumptions:\n",

    "1. The underlying $S(t)$ follows a lognormal random walk.\n",
    "2. The risk-free interest rate $r$ is a known function of time $t$.\n",
