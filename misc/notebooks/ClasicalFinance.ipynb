    "we usually sample from the normal distribution and build different paths. In this new approach we start by considering a discrete version of the normal distribution (similar to what we will do with the binomial model). Let's say that we have a discrete probability distribution composed of $M$ points. Then, we are going to compute the probability of all the possible paths that could produce this distribution. At the end we just have to approximate the expectation as a discrete average over all possible paths.\n"
